    "The **minimal standard** is defined as a Protocol, with some Abstract Base Classes. The protocol is minimal in that it provides for the most common [Use Cases](https://github.com/mcgfeller/py-schemas/blob/master/UseCases.md):\n",
    "* Serialization to an external representation\n",
    "* Deserialization from an external representation\n",
    "* Validation\n",
    "* Attach a Schema to an object class, and vice versa.\n",
    "* Obtaining Schema elements\n",
    "* Static type checking\n",
    "  * Get the Python type of a schema element \n",
    "* Minimal Schema transformation:\n",
    "  * Get a Type Annotation [PEP 593](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0593) from a Schema Element. If provided, the Type Annotation is standardized, ensuring interoperability of a schema element.\n",

    "* Associate data with Schema\n",

    "*The protocol doesn't provide a standard representation for Schemas or Schema Elements; it only provides standard access and use.* It does provide minimal conversion of arbitrary Schema features between schema libraries, as it provides conversion to Python static types and Type Annotation [PEP 593](https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-0593). See [Alternatives considered](alternatives.md).\n",

    "Using the Protocol for a single schema solution, such as **[Marshmallow](https://marshmallow.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)**, does not provide facilities superior to native usage. However, if the protocol is implemented by several libraries, integration of libraries using different schema facilities becomes much easier. The [Marshmallow ecosystem](https://github.com/marshmallow-code/marshmallow/wiki/Ecosystem) lists a few integrations (adaptions) to other libraries using Schemas (JSON, dataclasses, SQL Alchemy), each being a once-off ad-hoc solution. If a solution conforms to the standard, no adaption to other solutions will be required. \n"
